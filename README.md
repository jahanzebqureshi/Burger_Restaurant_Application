# Burger_Restaurant_Application

******** NOTE: STILL IN PROGRESS AS OF NOV 12, 2020 ********
A Burger Restaurant application that asks the user for questions to generate a burger. First, it asks them how many burgers they would like, the type of bread (e.g. whole wheat or white), and the number of toppings they want. Finally, the user is asked what the toppings are, and a receipt is printed which indicates the prices of each burger along with their respective toppings.
